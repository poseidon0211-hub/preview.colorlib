# Dynamic CSS Project: Focus on Motion, Variables, & Fluidity

This project is a clean, single-file CSS demonstration built to showcase advanced styling concepts, with a primary focus on dynamic motion, maintainability through variables, and fluid, function-based design.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.

- Motion (Transitions & Animations): All interactive elements feature smooth, intentional motion using CSS **`transition`** properties and **`@keyframes`** to enhance user feedback and visual appeal.

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Precision Transition Tuning: I focused on choosing appropriate timing functions (like cubic-bezier) for different elementsâ€”a linear ease for subtle color changes, and a more aggressive curve for positional changes like button lifts.

- Decoupling Variables: Confirmed the benefit of separating color variables (e.g., --color-primary) from use variables (e.g., --button-hover-bg) for future design system flexibility.

- Animation Stacking: Ensured custom entry animations (scaleIn) do not conflict with or override the standard CSS transitions applied to hover states.

### Continued development

- Reduced Motion: Implement the @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) query to gracefully disable all non-essential keyframe animations and soften transitions for users who prefer static layouts.


### Useful resources

- [MDN - CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascading_variables/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - This helped me for understanding variables well.

- [MDN - CSS Transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_transitions/Using_CSS_transitions) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand transitions.
